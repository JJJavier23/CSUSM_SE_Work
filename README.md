Portfolio of my works from CSUSM

Assignments and project during my second year at CSUSM from the following courses: Computer Science 1(c++ basics), Computer Science 2(OOP in c++), Assembly Language and Digital Circuits, Data Structures and Alogrithms(c++), 
Intro to Software Engineering(Java), Programming Lanuages(Python, F#, Prolog), Database Management Systems(SQL), Software Requirements and Specifications.

For my Intro to SE class we made teams of 3 and had to come up with a good enough project that would be challenging, yet achieveable in a semesters worth time. 
Using the Agile, method my team and I, created a schedule, plan, and execution accordingly to create the app we desired which was a CSUSM app that was more centered around the students and their needs rather than the school. 
That file is labeled "CSUSMStudentApp". Along with the project application, my team and I made a Software Requirements Specifications(SRS) document that entails the details about our project more.

Within my Software Testing Class, we were tasked to work in groups of 2 and given a game program, in this case a working version of Snake Game, and use the JUnit testing tool and functions along with Jacoco code coverage to test and make sure that there were no bugs within the code and that also are test case functions were proper reaching all branches of the code of the game. Using Java as our coding language, I have created multiple tests using edge graph coverage of code by first turning the given code into proper control flow graphs in order to then create proper tests that utilizes the edges between each node in order to fully maximize reaching each section of code within. Doing so lead to a reach of 99.0% of the given code coverage shown through the Jacoco code coverage application associated with the JUnit fucntions.

From my Software Architecture CLass, in groups of 3, we were given the task to improve upon an existing application made from an intro the SE course (SE 370) using the new knowledge and application use of different software design patterns that best fit th application we decided to improve upon. From this project my team has chosen to improve upon an existing Dungeons and Dragons (DND) Character Creator Application that allows the user to essentially just createa a DND character. Within the process we decided that out of all the software design patterns to implement the builder, factory, singleton, and mediator patterns appropriately for best usage and easy to read code and structure.

The other files contain the work done in my Data Sturctures and Algorithm class where we tackeled many different structures and was able to use and analyze them properly with their apparent runtime in accordance to the structure/algorithm used.
